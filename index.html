        <p>"Purple Rain"
        (from "Purple Rain" soundtrack)</p>
        <p>I never meant to cause you any sorrow
        I never meant to cause you any pain
        I only wanted one time to see you laughing
        I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain</p>
        <p>Purple rain, purple rain
        Purple rain, purple rain
        Purple rain, purple rain</p>
        <p>I only want to see you bathing in the purple rain</p>
        <p>I never wanted to be your weekend lover
        I only wanted to be some kind of friend
        Baby, I could never steal you from another
        It's such a shame our friendship had to end</p>

        <p>Purple rain, purple rain
        Purple rain, purple rain
        Purple rain, purple rain</p>
        <p>I only want to see you underneath the purple rain</p>
        <p>Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing
        It's time we all reach out for something new
        That means you too you say you want a leader</p>
        <p>But you can't seem to make up your mind
        I think you better close it
        And let me guide you to the purple rain</p>
        <p>Purple rain, purple rain
        Purple rain, purple rain</p>
        <p>If you know what I'm singing about up here
        C'mon, raise your hand</p>
        <p>Purple rain, purple rain</p>
        <p>I only want to see you, only want to see you
        In the purple rain</p>
